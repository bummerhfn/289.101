                      <p>Nuka-Cola, produced by the Nuka-Cola Corporation, was the most popular soft drink in the world before the Great War. After the War, many bottles of this pre-War favorite still survived, and Nuka-Cola remains one of the most popular soft drinks of the post-apocalyptic world. Their bottle caps are also famously used as currency<br>

<br>Nuka-Cola was invented in 2044 by John-Caleb Bradberton. Its unique taste gained widespread popularity, quickly becoming the most popular soft drink in the United States with an extremely dedicated following. The widely known dazzling blue bottle color was adopted as standard in 2052, after market research programs indicated that the blue color was the favorite in 86 people out of 100 polled.</p>

                      <p>The ingredients of Nuka-Cola include: carbonated water, caramel color, aspartame, phosphoric acid, potassium benzoate (to protect taste), natural flavors, citric acid, and caffeine. What gives it a unique flavor is the essence of seventeen different fruits mixed in just the right proportion to give the beverage its trademark taste. Some versions of the drink also include vita-minerals and health tonics. During the Great Passion Fruit Famine of 2044, people actually noticed the taste difference when the recipe was changed.<br>

<br>By 2067, vending machines with ice cold Nuka-Cola could be found on virtually every street in America, and even an amusement park in the Commonwealth.</p>
